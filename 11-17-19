Currectly working on Web Dev Bootcamp in Week 2.  Week one was mainly an into in Bootstrap and computer set up.  
Im using vs code as my main editor and have just begun the first project website.  The portfolio project has also been 
announced and I plan to dev a site for cupcakesbyshyla.com.  Week 1s study was relatively easy however I had
some trouble during the weekly assignment in class.  I will prepare specifically for week 2s class assignment
but I don't want to start on it prior to class. 



I have also rededicated myself to the ccna.  I plan to work more on book study and packet tracer, I will have to develop a 
schedule to use the live racks. Ive been labbing in pt for dhcp and multiple vlans. I can successfully configure dhcp for one 
for one vlan but can't for more than one.




Getting a new laptop has improved my productivity tremendously! I will complete the CCNA cert by the deadline and I will 
get the most that I can from the web dev bootcamp!

goodbye world!
