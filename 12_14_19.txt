I have just about completed the Bootstrap course with nucamp and working on my final project.
My goals were to have the navbar with logo, rotating carousel, order form and menu.
I have the navbar and carousel working. The carousel definitely isn't pretty. 
I need to work more with css to customize the coloring and image sizing.
I had to put all the images in the main directory, I was unable to get them to show
when I linked them from /images.

I felt overwhelmed at first but I was able to go thru the Bootstap documentation
as well as borrowing code from the Nucamp site.
All in all I am proud of what I have done and I know that I have plenty more to do.

Goodbye World
