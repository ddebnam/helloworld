Hello, World!

Today, I was able to to successfully install git locally as well as sync repositories thru the terminal. I have also considered 
looking into the GUI. I also watched and downloaded a repository for a Sneaker Bot. I altered the source code so that the
browser used is Chrome. I will download the necessary files so that firefox works, which was in the originial source
code. I need to learn more about proxies.


Signing out World!
